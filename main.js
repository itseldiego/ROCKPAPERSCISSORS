//creatfunction for computer choice **use math.random functin 
//random choice will be from 0 to .99, future update range will be different 
//three choices, .33,.66,and .99
//for testing purposes, ouput computer choice


//create function for users choice, using prompt ask user for their input
//task assumes user input will be correct, i will use a while loop in case of typo
// double check it matches the options if not, then let user know
// and add option of transformin answer regardless if its capitalized differently, as
// long as wording is correct, it will continue 
//be sure to return the user's and computer answer
// outside on the global scope, set 2 variables and initialize to 0 for future use when keeping score

//create function for 1 round, it will two paramaters: humanChoice and computerChoice
//using if statement first double check for tie and output a message if its a tie
//next either use computer's or user's choice to determine the winner,
//for example. humans/computer options = rock beats paper, paper beats rock, scissor beats paper 
//this part is what outputs the winning message, use ` $(variable)` to make it cleaner
//before printing the message, make sure to increment whichever option for winning score, 

//for this ill use human choice for ex humanChoice === "rock" && computerChoice === "scissor"...etc

//else output the winning message for the computer choice and increment their score

// now using a for loop, write a function called playgame that runs 5 times, 

//all code should be written at this point and all left to do is call them correctly inside this function

//issue: unable to open up console, due to auto prompts. disable and add instructions to open console first.
